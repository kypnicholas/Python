# MAP FUNCTION - allows you to "map" a function to an iterable object. That is to say you can quickly call the same function to every item in an iterable, such as a list. 

def square(num):
    return num**2

my_nums = [1,2,3,4,5]

map(square,my_nums)        # this will return the result in a location in memory. 

# To get the results, either cast to a list
list(map(square,my_nums))

# or iterate through map() 
for n in map(square,my_nums):
    print(n)
