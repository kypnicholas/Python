
# GENERATORS
# Generators allow us to generate as we go along, instead of holding everything in memory.
# We can construct our own Generators with the yield statement.

# When a generator function is compiled, they become an object thats supports an iteration protocol. 
# Best for calculating large sets of results in cases where we donâ€™t want to allocate the memory for all of the results at the same time.

# For example, the range() function doesn't produce a list in memory from start to stop. 
# Instead, it keeps track of the last number and the step size, to provide a flow of numbers. 
# If the used does need the list, they need to cast the generator to a list 
# list(range(0,10))

# produce the list in memory    -- NOT EFFICIENT. What if n = 1,000,000
